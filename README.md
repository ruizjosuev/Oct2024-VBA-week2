This involves a VBA script that analyzes stock data on a quarterly basis. The script should loop through all stocks in each quarter and output essential information, including:

The ticker symbol for each stock.
The quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of each quarter to the closing price at the end of the quarter.
The percentage change over the quarter.
The total stock volume.
Additionally, conditional formatting should be applied to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

the script identify:

The stock with the "Greatest % Increase."
The stock with the "Greatest % Decrease."
The stock with the "Greatest Total Volume."

the script runs on every worksheet (representing each quarter) simultaneously.

For development and testing, I used the alphabetical_testing.xlsx file.
